## Description

The Intermediate Database (IDB) is a concept that can be used to fill a neutral database with data from Vault or any other PDM system or from Windows Explorer. This IDB can be transformed into a BCP format which can be imported into Vault Professional or Vault Workgroup.   
This repository contains the IDB structure as well as a tool to convert the database to the Autodesk Vault BCP format. This format is finally used by Autodesk Vault DTU to mass import data into Vault.
